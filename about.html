    <p class="info">I am a UC Berkeley Alumni that graduated with a BS in Bioengineering. Currently, I am on my journey of becoming a Software Engineer.
      I have had exposure to algorithmic programming through college courses. During my previous occupation as an Integration Engineer at Epic Systems, I
      worked with SQL to generate internal reports for other engineers to better track submitting feedback. My goal is to eventually transition into blockchain engineering.
      Some of my hobbies include weight-training, snowboarding, trading, and golfing.
