    <p class="info">Hello! I am a UC Berkeley Alumni that graduated with a BS in Bioengineering. And currently, I am on my track as an aspiring Software Engineer.
      I have had minimal exposure to algorithmic coding through introductory college courses. I was previously employed as an Integration Engineer at Epic Systems where I
      used basic SQL to generate internal reports for other engineeers to better track submitting feedback. My goal is to eventually transition into blockchain engineering.
      Some of my hobbies include weight-training, snowboarding, trading, and making music playlists.
